# Restaurant Management App

A simple desktop-based Restaurant Management System built using Java Swing and JDBC, focused on managing restaurant menu items. The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including object-oriented design, loops, user input handling, and GUI integration.

## Features
- GUI-based interface using Java Swing
- Menu management – add, update, search, and retrieve menu items
- Database connectivity with JDBC
- Uses classes and objects, loops, and event-driven programming
- Persistent data storage and retrieval
- Input validation and basic error handling

## Technologies & Concepts Used
- Java
- Swing (GUI)
- JDBC (Database connectivity)
- OOP principles (classes & objects)
- Loops, conditional logic, and event listeners
- Input/output handling
- Search and update operations for menu data

## Project Workflow
- Designed GUI with Swing controls
- Formatted and structured application layout
- Linked actions to buttons and implemented business logic
- Compiled and tested the application
- Debugged and improved usability
- Documented code with helpful comments
