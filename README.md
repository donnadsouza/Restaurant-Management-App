- Uses classes and objects, loops, and event-driven programming
- Persistent data storage and retrieval
- Input validation and basic error handling

## Technologies & Concepts Used
- Java (JDK)
- Java Swing (GUI)
- MySQL (Database)
- JDBC (Database connectivity)
- OOP principles (classes & objects)
